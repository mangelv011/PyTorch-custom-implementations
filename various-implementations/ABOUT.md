# ABOUT.md

This repository contains custom deep learning components implemented in PyTorch, organized for educational and practical use. The `various-implementations` project focuses on building and testing core neural network modules from scratch, such as activations, layers, normalizations, optimizers, and pooling operations.

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for custom PyTorch modules (activations, layers, normalizations, optimizers, pooling, utilities).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the modules in `src/`.
