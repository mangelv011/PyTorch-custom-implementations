# Deep Learning Projects (Comillas ICAI)

This repository contains several deep learning projects and custom implementations developed during the Deep Learning course at Comillas ICAI. Each folder is a separate project:

- **MNIST-MLP**: MNIST digit recognition using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Imagenette-CNN**: Imagenette image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Optimization-and-Regularization**: Advanced CNN optimization and regularization techniques
- **RNN-LSTM**: RNN & LSTM models for electricity price prediction
- **various-implementations**: Various deep learning components, layers, activations, and exam review

For details on each project, see the corresponding `ABOUT.md` file inside each folder.
