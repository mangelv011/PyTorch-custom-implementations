# PyTorch Custom Implementations

This repository contains several deep learning projects and custom PyTorch implementations, all developed during the subject Deep Learning at Comillas ICAI. Each folder is a separate project, covering a range of neural network architectures, optimization techniques, and practical applications.

## Projects Overview

- **MNIST-MLP**: MNIST digit recognition using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Includes training scripts, model checkpoints, and evaluation utilities.
- **Imagenette-CNN**: Image classification on the Imagenette dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks. Contains custom model definitions, training routines, and performance analysis.
- **Optimization-and-Regularization**: Advanced CNN optimization and regularization techniques. Explores methods such as weight decay, dropout, and learning rate scheduling to improve model generalization.
- **RNN-LSTM**: Time series prediction for electricity prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
- **various-implementations**: A collection of custom deep learning components, including layers, activations, normalizations, optimizers, and pooling operations. Useful for exam review and experimentation.

## Structure & Usage

- All code is organized by project folder. Each project contains its own source code (`src/`), tests (`tests/`), models, and data (if applicable).
- Scripts and modules are implemented using PyTorch and standard Python libraries.
- For details, usage instructions, and specific requirements, see the corresponding `ABOUT.md` file inside each folder.
